notes : |
 Most MEFs express H19 and at high level; can see that some cells are biased, others clearly biallelic
 Positions 1-40 were taken on 080514 (or slightly after midnight), 41-50 from 080614
 Positions 8+9, 10+11, 13+14, 16+17 (7) are paired
 Position 50 is representative of a large cluster (15 MEFs seen in eyepiece, more around that)
